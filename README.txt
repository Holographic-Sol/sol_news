etc.

More crawlers is more news.

I will refine it a little but not much. Why? because html changes. And id just like to read the news in my terminal
or notepad without being data raped. come on.. ad's are enough.

If Sol News is always running then you always have somewhere to turn for a clue if it all goes bad, Sol News.
