Internet goes down, everyone is told to stay in they're homes. You know where to go.. Sol News

Windows:
1. On Windows run news_collector.bat
2. Go and make a coffee...
3. Drink said coffee while reading the news stored in news_articles directory.

Android:
1. termux app
2. git clone https://github.com/Holographic-Sol/sol_news
3. cd sol_news (into directory containing news_collector_android.py)
4. python news_collector_android.py
6. cat the article file

More crawlers is more news.

I will refine it a little but not much. Why? because html changes. And id just like to read the news in my terminal
or notepad without being data raped. come on.. ad's are enough.
